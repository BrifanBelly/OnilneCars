"name":"2017 Subaru BRZ",
"speed": "120",
"decription":"Refreshed and refined.",
"msrp":"20,200",
"options":"The bright and sunny BRZ borrows more than its period-centric naming convention from the Series.Hyperblue—it is more or less a Series.Hyperblue with all of the blue-colored accents inside and out replaced with yellow ones. There’s the paint, of course, as well as yellow contrast stitching and bits of yellow cloth throughout the otherwise black cabin, and black-painted 17-inch wheels"
