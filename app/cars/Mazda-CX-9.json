"name":"2016 Mazda CX-9 AWD",
"speed": "120",
"decription":"Three-row crossovers are the new minivans. They haul families and stuff with increasingly bland sameness. But what if there existed an affordable option that's attractive and fun to drive?",
"msrp":"32,605",
"options":"The Mazda’s unflinching excellence, including the sweet shifter and clutch, talkative steering, outstanding ride/handling balance, and upscale feel. But mostly, those of us at the home office in Ann Arbor like having it back in our hands. Last summer, we sent the 3 out to Montana with John Phillips, and normally, when he migrates back to Michigan for 10Best Cars testing in the fall, he swaps cars. That didn’t happen this time—smitten with the Mazda, he sneaked it away for round two of his fling while the rest of us slept off our hangovers. We finally recovered it and brought it home as the season’s first snow was falling."
