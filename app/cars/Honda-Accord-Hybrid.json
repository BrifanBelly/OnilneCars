"decription":"The greenest Accord is not our favorite Accord",
"msrp":"30,440",
"options":"In spite of superior engineering, Honda hybrids have never posed a serious threat to the Toyota Prius. In 1999, the original Honda Insight hybrid beat the Prius to the U.S. market by a few months with a small motor-generator attached to its three-cylinder gas engineâ€™s crankshaft. Accord hybrids sold for the 2014 and 2015 model years had a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine and two motor-generators capable of providing electric-only, gas-only, or mixed gas and electric propulsion with no need for efficiency-sapping gearchanges.
