"name":"2017 Smart Fortwo Brabus",
"speed": "120",
"decription":"The latest Smart gets an attitude.",
"msrp":"19,650",
"options":"OPTIONS: Titania grey matte body panels ($450) Black Tridium cell ($0) Fog lights ($110) Center armrest ($100) Lighting package ($400) Height-adjustable driver’s seat ($100) Panoramic roof ($350) Heated seats ($240) Orange and black cloth interior ($0) What’s most surprising about the Fortwo’s plethora of options for body panel colors, interior schemes, and various knick-knacks isn’t the breadth of choices—it’s that none of the extras we added cost more than $500. As a result, we had no qualms over adding seven (!) extra-cost items to flesh out our Passion coupe. Starting with the car’s exterior, we painted the exposed portion of the Fortwo’s Tridium safety cage a glossy black. For the body panels, we ordered up a butch-looking matte-grey hue; we’ve seen this combination in person and must say, it eliminates nearly all of the Smart’s inherent cuteness. Not that we’d be self-conscious behind the wheel of a Fortwo or anything."
