"name":"2017 Infiniti QX30 AWD",
"speed": "120",
"decription":"Infiniti throws its hat into the tiny-crossover ring.",
"msrp":"35,350",
"options":"Crossovers continue to crowd showrooms across the nation, but few have styling as distinctive as the QX30. A sweeping roofline and a high beltline make the cabin feel small and outward visibility seem compromisedâ€”that's the price for fashion. A 208-hp 2.0-liter turbo four-cylinder drives the front or all four wheels through a seven-speed automatic. A well-appointed, attractive cabin features a 7.0-inch touchscreen infotainment screen; a firm suspension offers fun when the road turns twisty. "
