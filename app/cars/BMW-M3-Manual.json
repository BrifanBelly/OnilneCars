"options":"BMW has been unafraid to tailor its M3 to the times. Over the past 29 years, the M3’s cylinder counts and transmission choices and even body styles have changed. These moves have had corresponding effects on comfort, luxury, and reliability, yet the M3 has always maintained its status as a no-compromise machine. Each of its five generations has offered a slightly different balance between street and track performance, with the underlying idea that this car could excel spectacularly at both disciplines. But after spending 17 months with the ­latest M3, we’ve come away thinking that Munich’s scales need recalibrating. "
