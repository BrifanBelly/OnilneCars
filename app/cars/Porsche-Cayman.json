"options":"The mid-engined Porsche Cayman was launched in 2005. Essentially a coupe version of the Boxster , the Cayman has become increasingly popular with customers as a more affordable and balanced proposition to the range-topping 911. The first-generation coupe came with 2.7-, 2.9-, and 3.4-liter, flat-six engines with as many as 321 ponies and 273 pound-feet of torque. A facelifted Cayman was introduced in early 2009, while the redesigned model arrived in showrooms in 2013, this time powered by 275-, 325- and 340-horsepower engines. As weâ€™re moving closer to the 2017 model year, the Germans are preparing a mid-cycle refresh for the still-new Cayman."
