"options":"At a length of 255.9 inches, the Pullman is more than four feet longer than a Mercedes-Benz S-class; itâ€™s also four inches taller. Daimler says the rear compartment resembles a \"club lounge.\" In standard configuration, the Pullman comes with two chairs facing forward and two rearward-facing fold-down seats for minions accompanying the VIPs. Those extra seats can, of course, be deleted, and the possibilities for individualization are virtually endless. "
