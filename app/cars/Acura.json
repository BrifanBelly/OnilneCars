"options":"Competing, as ever, in the class of $30,000-ish luxury cars that aren’t really luxury cars, the ILX remains essentially a fortified Honda Civic. Additional mid-product-cycle polish comes to its specifications mostly by discarding the old car’s 150-hp, 2.0-liter four-cylinder and five-speed automatic in favor of a direct-injected 2.4-liter four that makes 201 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque. Honda’s novel torque-converter-equipped dual-clutch automatic transmission now swaps eight forward gears and drops cruising revs to a palatable level, a great improvement over the old car’s high-strung powertrain"
